# Anesthesia-based-Patient-Monitoring-using Blockchain and Explainable AI
"This project focuses on predicting the appropriate amount of anesthesia to be administered to a patient by monitoring their vital signs and we use blockchain for securing the patients data and use of explainable AI for the transparecy of the system which could give explaination on how much amount of anesthesia is been predicted based on what factors"
